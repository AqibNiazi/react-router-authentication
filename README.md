## README Structure

### 1. Project Title & Description

**React Router Playground**
*A hands-on project to explore and compare React Router v6 and v7 features, patterns, and routing techniques.* ([GitHub][1])

### 2. Table of Contents

* Overview
* Demo / Screenshots (optional)
* Features
* Setup & Installation
* Usage
* Project Structure
* Notes & Learnings
* Technologies Used
* Contributing
* License

### 3. Overview

This repo is an **events app architecture** designed for practicing:

* Routing with React Router v6 and v7
* Form handling using React Router v7's `action` APIs
* Comparing routing strategies across versions

### 4. Demo / Screenshots (Optional)

Embed screenshots or a GIF of navigating between routes or submitting forms to provide a visual cue.

### 5. Features

* Navigation using `<Routes>`, `<Route>`, and `<Outlet>`
* Nested layouts and dynamic routing
* Form handling using React Router v7’s `action` and `loader`
* Conditional rendering and error boundaries
* Version-to-version comparison of patterns and practices

### 6. Setup & Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AqibNiazi/react-router-playground.git
cd react-router-playground
# If there's a frontend and backend:
# cd frontend || cd backend
npm install
npm run dev # or npm start
```

### 7. Usage

1. Launch the local dev server.
2. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or the port specified).
3. Navigate between different routes—see how routing works in each version and how forms are handled.
4. Inspect form submissions and navigation flows in the console or dev tools.

### 8. Project Structure (Example)

```
/frontend
  ├── src/
      ├── components/
      ├── routes/
      ├── layout/
      ├── App.jsx
  ├── package.json

/backend (if present)
  ├── handlers/
  ├── package.json
```

You can tweak this layout based on the actual directory structure as seen on GitHub ([GitHub][1]).

### 9. Notes & Learnings

* Highlight key differences between v6 and v7 (e.g., form handling with `action`, improved nested routing).
* Share any pitfalls or breakthroughs you encountered.
* Invite readers to explore, modify, and experiment to deepen their understanding.

### 10. Technologies Used

* React
* React Router v6 & v7
* CSS & HTML
* (Mention any build tools or frameworks like Vite, Webpack, etc., if applicable.)

### 11. Contributing

Briefly mention how others can contribute:

* Fork the repo
* Create a feature branch
* Submit pull requests
* Report bugs or suggestions via Issues

### 12. License

If you're using MIT or another license—state it clearly.
